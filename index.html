      <h3>About</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          From my teenage years, I've always been drawn to the world of
          computers. I still remember configuring the control panel on my old
          Windows 7 PC. There was just something so satisfying about adjusting
          the settings and really getting to understand how the system worked.
          That sense of discovery and curiosity has stuck with me ever since my
          teenage years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, as I got a laptop from my family that I named Eva, a friend
          introduced me to Linux, starting with Kali Linux for delving into
          ethical hacking. I began experimenting with various Linux
          distributions. From Ubuntu to Fedora, I expanded my knowledge with
          each installation.
