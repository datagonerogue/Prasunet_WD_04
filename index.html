          <p>
            From my teenage years, I've always been drawn to the world of
            computers. I still remember configuring the control panel on my old
            Windows 7 PC. There was just something so satisfying about adjusting
            the settings and really getting to understand how the system worked.
            That sense of discovery and curiosity has stuck with me ever since
            my teenage years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, as I got a laptop from my family that I named Eva, a friend
            introduced me to Linux, starting with Kali Linux for delving into
            ethical hacking. I began experimenting with various Linux
            distributions. From Ubuntu to Fedora, I expanded my knowledge with
            each installation.
